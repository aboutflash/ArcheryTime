The interesting change is how the DatagramPacket
is constructed, in particular, the InetAddress
and port used to construct the DatagramPacket.
Recall that the previous example retrieved the
InetAddress and port number from the packet sent
to the server from the client. This was because
the server needed to reply directly to the client.
Now, the server needs to address multiple clients.
So this time both the InetAddress and the port
number are hard-coded.
The hard-coded port number is 4446 (the client must
have a MulticastSocket bound to this port).
The hard-coded InetAddress of the DatagramPacket
is "203.0.113.0" and is a group identifier (rather
than the Internet address of the machine on which
a single client is running).
This particular address was arbitrarily chosen
from the reserved for this purpose.
